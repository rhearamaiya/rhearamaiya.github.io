    <h3><b>What is Each One Teach One?</b></h3>
    <p>Each One Teach One is a peer-tutoring program started and run by students at Vernon Hills High School in order to give students in the local community the help they need from tutors who care. All tutors have gone through a careful process in order to be admitted into the program, so you can be sure all tutors are qualified and prepared to teach your student. We currently have over 50 local students and tutors participating, so don't wait to get started!

        <h2><u>How does it work?</u></h2>
        <p>After you fill out a form describing what subject your child needs help with, we match you up with the most appropriate high-school tutor we have available. We will let you know through email when we have found a tutor, and from there, you coordinate directly with the tutor when, where, and how many times a week tutoring sessions will be held.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prop">
        <h2><u>How much does it cost?</u></h2>
        <p>Since this is a solely volunteer-based program, all the tutoring services are free! Tutors will gain leadership experience and volunteer hours (for NHS Application Hours, College, etc.) in exchange for their services, while students will gain the help they need from qualified tutors who want them to succeed. </p>
